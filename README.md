Data Science Bowl Kaggle - PBS Kids

Our primary kernel script submitted to the kaggle kernel for the 2019 Data Science Bowl.

Was written in R markdown.

The dataset was around 4GB and is basically an event-log of what different kids were doing while playing on a ipad game app developed by PBS. The goal was to use these log-records to predict the performance of individual kids on test questions/tasks.
